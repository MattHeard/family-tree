# Family Tree

## Description

Display a collapsible, animated family tree.

## Instructions

1. Run a local server to serve HTML and JavaScript. (For example, `python3`.)

        $ cd ${FAMILY_TREE_ROOT}
        $ python3 -m http.server

2. Visit `family_tree.html` in your browser. (`python3` will serve it at `localhost:8000/family_tree.html` by default.)
